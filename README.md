# YR.NQt
App for yr.no written in Qt. 

My first time using Qt framework and coding in C++ after a looong while. 
It's using Qt 5.5, gets data from Yr.no, even the pictures. :)
I'm using QWidgets instead of Qml what's going to change in future :) I like this framework but I need to code muuch mroe :)
